# Portfolio

I want to have a static landing page that links to other projects.
If all I'm adding are these 3 projects, I'll just have a menu/links
you can click on to get to view the actual projects.

For Project 1, which is a site, I'll have a few screenshots and a link to the site.
For Project 2, similarly, I'll have a few screenshots and then embed the actual video.
For Project 3, I'll have some screenshots and a link to the game.

All projects will have short descriptions.
The layout of each page might change, but remain more similar than different.
I want there to be some type of consistency, but I might make each page a little different.
I want the site to feel fun, welcoming, and whimsical.

I already have a personal portfolio website on Behance, but this will be an interesting exercise to write my own site frmo scratch. I might link another project I've done, or link to the behance portfolio itself on this site.
