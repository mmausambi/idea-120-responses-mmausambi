## We walk ##

Heavy, thick, impenetrable, the air hangs over the forest trees. 
We step, step, step, one foot in front of the other, thousands of us, millions of us, or maybe more?
There's food here, some sweet, juice dripping down our sticky fingers, 
others bitter, making our stomaches ache and ache and ache.
Still, we walk.
Millions of us, billions of us, trillions of us, we cut our own paths, we make our houses high and low, we chart courses,
We walk, we sprint, we jump, we swim, we fly.
