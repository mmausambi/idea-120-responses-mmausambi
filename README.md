## We walk ##

Heavy, thick, impenetrable, the air hangs over the forest trees. <br />
We step, step, step, one foot in front of the other, thousands of us, millions of us, or maybe more?<br />
There's food here, some sweet, juice dripping down our sticky fingers, <br />
others bitter, making our stomaches ache and ache and ache.<br />
Still, we walk.<br />
Millions of us, billions of us, trillions of us, we cut our own paths, we make our houses high and low, we chart courses,<br />
We walk, we sprint, we jump, we swim, we fly.<br />
