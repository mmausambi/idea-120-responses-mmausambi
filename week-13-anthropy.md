# The games we play

1. "A game is an experience created by rules."
And then Anthropy goes on to wonder if her definition is too broad, bringing up the example that filling out tax forms would fit under her definition. But she elaborates that the experience of gaming makes games different from methods like filling out tax returns, and that classifying your taxes as a game isn't very useful, so it doesn't count as a game.

I understand that she didn't want to exclude any games with her definition, which is the point of her definition being so broad.
But I'm wondering, if there is a more precise word than "experience" to use here, which would be less vague. I like her definition, but it's very subjective. Which may be useful at times, to make people really think what is and isn't a game.

For me, personally, gaming would be defined by even broader terms than Anthropy's. Something is a game if you find it fun. Often, games make me think of stakes, and stakes are there only because "losing" a game is a possibility. But there are games where you can't lose, but you have fun with anyway, such as many twine stories, or games that focus purely on exploration. My definition seems too broad, but that's because I think someone *can* think of filling tax returns as a game. Maybe something like, "If I get this done before 5, I get to treat myself to desert." That immediately turns the act into a game, though it might not be a very fun one... which immediately throws my definition out the window.

Many games are educational, and might not strictly be for fun, like games that teach the player about pollution, or the game *Gang Rape* that Anthropy mentions.
Trying to define what is and isn't a game might be akin to the age-old argument of what is, and isn't, art. So many people have different answers.

2. I love that Anthropy says games are the best at making players think more deeply about systems and relationships. I never thought about it that way.
But as I read her chapter, of her explaining that freeze tag makes players question themselves with 'is it worth the risk of getting frozen myself to unfreeze another player,' and other rules, it was pretty interesting.
She describes games as plays. The actors change, but the actual game often remains the same.
How will J play freeze tag versus K? J might not like taking risks, but they prioritize winning, so they need to unfreeze tagged players to prevent IT from winning (and because more people vs the IT means there's less of the IT's attention focused on themself).
K might love taunting IT, but they might be terrible at teamwork, meaning they might not read that J looking over their shoulder means the IT is nearby, or maybe there's someone frozen that K doesn't like so they don't unfreeze them. Maybe O likes hiding from the IT, and likes not being found throughout the course of the game, so they flit from one hiding spot to another.
Etcetera.
There is a lot going on in a simple game of freeze tag, with reading body language, risk assessment, relationships.

3. I also loved Anthropy bringing up the relationship between culture and folk games. I never thought of it that way, that tag and chess may not have been made by one or two people, but a culture and a people, whose thought processes can be revealed through the rules they make for the games they play. That's such a complicated process, layers and layers of people and thought and ideas, producing a product of culture that we call a "game."
