"interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure"

  I agree with that quote.
  
  Everything about society tells us how to structure our lives, from the location and structure of our houses, to the clothes we wear, and the food we eat. All of these are designed by humans, for humans, and so, they're all made with some type of intention. None of it is freedom of expression intrinsic in and of itself, since there are rules and expectations, and you have to conform to the way society functions. Similarly, social media is no different.

  Currently, what comes to mind is reels on Instagram.

 Practically every artist on Instagram is currently complaining that in introducing reels like TikTok, Instagram has conflated the value of its reels and have forced artists to make reels to get an audience. The past few weeks of Instagram reels have just been artists posting how surprised they are that one or two of their reels instantly propelled them to thousands on ten thousands of views and followers. This also comes with artists posting reels just to announce, "I'm sick of being a content creator for Instagram's algorithm. The algorithm is really not working to artists' best interests right now."

 It's the act of creating a culture where media is delivered all in the same format: very short videos with catchy songs and some type of movement on-screen that viewers can grasp within a few seconds, and then move on. I've heard people say it's contributing to lower-attention spans and "doom scrolling." Viewers think they aren't spending much time at all on these platforms since they're consuming so many different posts but they're all only a few seconds each. But they're compelled to keep scrolling, and scrolling... for hours at a time. It's akin fast food. You can eat as much as you want, but ultimately, it's designed to be addicting, to make you hungry for more, while never quite being able to make you full since you never consume something "whole," because you're only consuming very short bits of information.
