# A Proposal for Project 2: Green Screen

I want to somehow be underwater, and maybe there's a person there with me who isn't actually there. Perhaps a body-double sort of situation. Maybe they climb in through a window, or maybe I have a pet or something with me trying to interact with me (that isn't actually there.) Something along these lines... I don't have any concrete ideas yet, but after we discuss how to use Adobe Premiere maybe I'd be more aware of what is realistically possible within the time constraints.
