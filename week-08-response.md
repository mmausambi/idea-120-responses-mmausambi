#Data and the Internet

<strong>Discuss in about 2 paragraphs what methods outlined by O'Neil and Chalabi you believe you're subject to when using tools and consuming media on the internet. </strong>

Everyone is probably being subject to trackers from google and other sites that follow their digital footprints to see what they click on and what they search up. Like the O'Neil reading said, that leads to people getting profiled and saved on databases that send users targeted content, which could include ads from parasitic organizations like some for-profit universities who prey on people's lives to make their own gains.

<strong>Would the internet be more useful and egalitarian without these methods (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design), or is it useful to direct users because your message could otherwise be lost among the sea of online content?</strong>

The danger of targeted content, aside from parasitic examples of capitalism at work, is living in a bubble. When you're not being exposed to content you wouldn't search for yourself, you won't be exposed to views opposing to your own (unless you're social media platforms who see hate as a legitimate way of making people engage more with their platforms, and thus purposefully present users with content they'd disagree with to spark anger and argument).
I'm not opposed to the user influencing the type of content they are given to engage with. On the other hand, this is how fake news/misinformation spreads and people become more entrenched in views that may be damaging to themselves and to the people around them.
I don't have enough information to answer this question. But big companies whose sole interests are making profits really shouldn't have comprehensive data on everyone who uses their platforms. Nothing good comes from lack of transparency and unclear intentions with data on the scale they're collecting.
