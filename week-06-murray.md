How does Murray's prediction compare to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabit while acting? Name and discuss the different layers of 'reality' both the actors and the viewers experience in the production.

I don’t think what Murray describes is strictly expressed in “The Mandalorian.” What Murray describes, is something the entire audience experiences. What happened in the “The Mandalorian,” was a new way of shooting movies. Maybe the parallels are that the actors were more ‘immersed’ in the realities that their audience would ultimately come to see on-screen. They could see what their director wanted them to see. I think the limitation in Murray’s argument, and likening his argument to the set of “The Mandalorian,” is the lack of consideration for the imagination. What did getting rid of the green screen and replacing it with an actual screen depicting the director’s intentions do? It got rid of the ‘imagination,’ aspect of their acting. It just made sure everyone was looking at the same thing. What the actors were looking at when it was only the green screen and everything was left to their imaginations, no one can guess. The abstract ideas and thoughts each actor might’ve had, replaced by a screen telling you, concretely, what is.

In this file discuss if you believe Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful.

No.
No, he was a bit too... I have one of two ideas:
1) He was ahead of his times.
2) He overestimated humanity.

Assuming he was simply ahead of his times and his predictions just still have not come to pass, then there is some merit to his theory. Media may become more participatory in the future. People might want to immerse themselves very fully in day-to-day entertainment.
My other theory, that he overestimated humanity, is as follows: people are lazy. Many people who enjoy television these days watch it in-between stressful jobs, or as a way to wind down and engage in a task that doesn't involve as much thinking after a hard day's work-- a hot medium, which lets their minds relax and stop spinning gears as they sit back and enjoy the story. Murray believes that the future of media lies in the younger generations, who will increasingly be exposed to cold mediums and will find hot mediums understimulating and stale, or limiting. That future generations will want more and more to deeply engage with stories, become a part of these stories and play active roles of thinking through these stories and participating in them as they happen, while also exploring the environments of these stories on their own time to piece together more information. Murrary thinks that though people who prefer traditional forms of medium, like the linear story telling in books and movies, would still exist, he thinks that, as a rule of thumb, most people would want to engage in a medium they can actively participate in.
In my opinion, he's wrong.
He's talking about stories like they showed up with the television, a novel new thing seen in television shows. He talks about movies and books like they're limiting mediums, that most people will want to explore, and not be led around by, the story-tellers. Since the beginning of humanity, stories have existed in many formats. Word-of-mouth, art, etc. Stories, for all of these millenia, have often existed as linear story-telling: a story-teller expressing the story to an audience, through whatever medium was available, in one linear fashion. And the fact of the matter is, story-telling is an art form. It's something you can learn, something that storytellers have repeatedly mastered through different mediums over the ages. Writers and movie-makers have studied many years to be good at what they do, to weave a story that dazzles the senses and transports their audience to different places. The beauty in that, is imagination. Every member of the audience already experiences any one story in a multitude of different ways. We're all different, and we'll all perceive the stories we experience differently, notice different things about them, understand different things about them.
Murray thinks that these mediums will ultimately become limiting. That linear story-telling is a traditional method of the past, to be trumped by a multibranching fashion of storytelling. The future he describes may come to pass. Now, if we assume that everything he’s talked about is possible and has come to pass, where’s the limit? He’s basically saying that the best stories are ones where the audience has lived in themselves. They’ll live as a fantasy species in a different planet for years at a time as they experience the main storyline and engage in story lines of their own. Fine. Alright. Sounds interesting enough. Escapism coming to whole new levels as viewers are allowed to actually live entirely different lives in a physical way that books and movies and radio shows and art hasn’t done for them in the past. What are the limits of that new medium, which Murray is describing? If we pushed past even the future that Murray describes, where would entertainment and media go?
The answer is frightening. In Fahrenheit 451, such technology is alluded to. People who’ve given up their lives to live in realistic, holographic roleplaying that makes them the protagonists of amazing stories. Who no longer know what is reality and what is not. Who’d rather prefer the reality in their holographic headsets than the realities they live in. There are no limits. Humans, living in worlds of humans’ creations. There is no line between ‘real’ life and the lives they can experience in these alternate realities, except that their physical bodies still need very real sustenance. The ways in which things could go wrong are endless. Mildred, the protagonist’s wife in Fahrenheit 451, became more attached to her holographic family in a daily soap opera than her own. The makers of the soap opera? Would they feel like gods, dictating and directing the kinds of worlds they make their audiences physically reside in?
Just because this kind of technology is possible, we can’t dismiss all the implications of making them happen.
Now, going back to the future of entertainment as Murray has described— cyberdramas. He talks about creating realities where the interface is intuitive enough that it doesn’t impede the story-telling, giving every audience maximum agency and freedom to move around and act in these stories in any way they want, alongside experiencing the main story line, which they will witness as it happens to scripted characters in periodic, broadcasted dramas that they can explore in any way they want (following different characters, picking up from different points in the story). He talks about roleplaying, either with “scripted actors, fellow improvisers, or computer-based chatterbots” (247) to make this reality come true, and how authors will work together to create this reality, to ensure that the audience will experience these stories as fully as possible. To account for every human action is no simple matter. The reality he describes… needs technology to have advanced a lot. I thought at first he meant the audience would float around to experience these stories, without a physical body, but he says that the audience will become people in these fantastical worlds, who live alongside the characters that are the focus of these dramas. The future he describes is indeed interesting and enticing, in a sense.
He relates these realities that people could live in, to games that already exist on PC and other mediums. And that’s what he’s essentially describing, it seems like, to me: a game. A main story line, and many branching storylines, a world you can explore at your leisure, etc. This type of story telling has already been implemented by many popular games played today. What he’s describing is a game. He even says: “It will not be an interactive this or that, however much it may draw upon tradition, but a reinvention of story-telling itself for the new digital medium (247), in which he means, these cyberdramas will not just be an extension of movies or books, or any existing format of story telling, but will be a completely new medium. I agree with that. The form of entertainment he describes can’t replace the careful direction of books and movies, so they shouldn’t be compared to them. And they won’t replace them. I may sound too ‘traditional,’ as Murray might call it, but that’s just my opinion.
