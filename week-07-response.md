# Technology and Ethics

<div>
As someone who has a younger sister of 5 years old, I couldn't help but agree with James Birdle's article. My parents both work, and I have school work, so my sister is often, for some periods of time, left unsupervised with the TV as all of us are busy working. To stress the point-- only with the TV, since she's not allowed to watch anything on an iPad or a phone specifically for the reasons Birdle points out throughout his article-- that the internet is not a space for children.

I agree with him. Sometimes, I find my sister watching content that is innately disturbing in some sense, and some videos led her to play some disturbing games with her dolls (ranging from pretending her dolls were pregnant with a child, to blindfolding and tying the hands of her dolls to turn them into hostages of some sort. Both scenarios were disturbing to walk into, since she is only 4-5 years old in both cases). My mom often tells me to stay with my sister while she's watching TV to catch these sorts of channels, to make sure she's only watching kid-friendly content.

Continuing from a past week's reading on algorithms going wrong, this fits perfectly. Misinformation and violence can spread through the same channels that allow children to see content they weren't meant to see. It's creating whole new problems that we don't know how to deal with yet, because we don't yet fully grasp how it's affecting our realities.

Just as the internet provides infinite possibilities for self-expression, it exposes all of us to each other's thoughts in new ways, and some kinds of self-expression may not be forms all of us want exposure to, or even <em>know</em> if we want exposure to. Like Birdle says, it's a kind of violence, being done to all of us, by a combination of people and machines.

But censorship doesn't sit right with me... In a country of democracy, allowing types of media to be blocked from users and restrict the Misinformation they can access... I'm not sure <em>what</em> the solution is to the problems Birdle describes. But where things start to go wrong, is when a small group of people are allowed to decide what the majority of us are allowed to experience. Then it goes out of any individual's hands, and they lose control and say over their own lives. Limiting freedom of expression for everyone's safety and well-being is important. But again, it is what it is: limiting freedom of expression. As technology evolves more and more, we need to figure out the ethics of the systems we use in our everyday lives.
