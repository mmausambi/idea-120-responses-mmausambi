I'm an artist on Instagram. When I first got on this platform, it was after some internal debating and short periods of research into whether or not having an Instagram account would really be useful to an artist. I'm usually not on social media, and have little experience with navigating them. So tags? Followers? Likes? I didn't know how to maneuver through much of this territory, and stay on the fringes of Instagram, posting some sketches every week to have a public account of my art progress. While I've been on here, I've seen many people complain about the Instagram algorithm. It's common enough to see captions like, "Here is my offering today to the Instagram algorithm," "Linked in my bio are some ways you can use Instagram's algorithm to work for you," "Here are some tags that Instagram's algorithm promotes," "Instagram's algorithm is shit and it's affecting my mental health so I'm leaving this toxic platform."

I've seen plenty of artists on Instagram complaining about this mystical thing called "the Instagram algorithm," though I didn't understand what this algorithm was, or how it was used, just that if you wanted views, you had to talk to someone who knew more about this algorithm/has been able to be popular through this algorithm, and learn from them. I'm not too interested in social media yet, so I've yet to do any of that. But I know enough to know this-- there are plenty of artists suffering because they can't figure out how to get noticed by Instagram's algorithm, how to get their work in front of people (and their own followers) so they can have their work appreciated. Recently, there have been posts that say "Instagram is only showing your art to 1 out 7 of your followers," "Instagram doesn't value likes, it values comments, so please leave a comment if you want to support my art," "I don't know why, but adding this audio to my reels gets my art views, so here I go," "Instagram supports sketches and not completed work, so here it is," "I'm posting a few art memes because the algorithm likes relatable content," etc.

There's been backlash to all this, people complaining that the platform is turning artists     into "content creators," turning them into people creating content solely to cater to an algorithm no one really understands, in order to get views. There's been some artists who've gotten fed-up with cropping their work into squares (or doing all their work on square canvases to begin with), or their favorite artists getting significantly fewer followers than artists who post lower-quality content that works with the algorithm. The medium is painfully starting to affect its content, in this case. Artists are making art <em>for</em> this algorithm. I would classify that as a WMD (weapon of math destruction).
