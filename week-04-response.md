<br />
*Trashmaid* is an on-going comic on Webtoon, by s0s2, an online artist.
<br />
The comic is a slice-of-life/comedy with much darker undertones, about a mermaid who lives near the shore, and every illustration is a humourous account of her and the two humans she meets. Though the tone of the comic is light, the artist very much wants to emphasize that reality is much darker in the oceans than we'd like to believe. Every episode brings a new aspect of pollution into focus.

If this were something promoted by Disney, or supported by government sources, it would take on a whole other meaning. The visuals that s0s2 uses often get distrubing and vivid, and it would shock audiences.

The **denoted linguistic** messages here are the 2 Lay's chip packets, and the 7/11 shirt the mermaid has on. The chips packets are tied around by some type of string, and floating like balloons from the mermaid'd hand. The 7/11 bag seems to be the mermaid's shirt. The caption, which reads 'Underwater Balloons.'

**The connoted linguistic** messages on the other hand, are darker.
Showing these brand names could be seen as ways of advertising these products, but they're not really being put in a positive light in this image. They more or less reflect the reality of poullution in our oceans today, about much of the world's trash being dumped in the oceans, and plastic packets/bags like these not biodegrading over time. These aren't said outright in the image, but they're implied. To understand these implications, the viewer must be aware there is some level of pollution in the ocean, and understand that this is a dark topic being portrayed in a light-hearted sense, of a cartoonish mermaid holding 'baloons' and wearing whimsical clothing-- in other words, dark humor.

The **non-coded iconic** messages here are the plastic stuck around the mermaid's tail. The pieces of metal wrapped around her wrist. The small holes at the end of her tail. The plastic bag she's chosen as her shirt. Her wide smile, and the two floating chip bags on string that act like sort-of balloons.

The **coded iconic** messages here are that all of these are pieces of pollution, that the mermaid has had to live in. They've become so common, she's taken them as part of her everyday life, as if this is the way things have always been. She has the expression of a delighted child at a park as she lives in this reality, the water a muddy grey in the background. Nothing like the imagery the viewer would probably like to imagine, of the ocean.
